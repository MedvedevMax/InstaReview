# InstaReview

### Description
InstaReview is an iOS application that finds reviews on a book by taking a photo of its cover. It's a thin-client application so all it does is snapping a photo, preparing it for the recognition and sending it to the server. The server sends the responce, whether the book recognized or not and reviews on it.
